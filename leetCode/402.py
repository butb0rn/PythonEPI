'''
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

    out = []
    for d in num:
        while k and out and out[-1] > d:
            out.pop()
            k -= 1
        out.append(d)
    return ''.join(out[:-k or None]).lstrip('0') or '0'



l = "1432219"
print removeKdigits(l, 3)
